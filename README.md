# Minimal Portfolio Website ðŸš€

This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work and skills as a developer. The idea is to have a minimal and clean design that provides all the necessary information to recruiters and potential clients.

## How to modify for your own use ðŸ¤”

Once you've forked / cloned the repository, you can modify the following files to display your own information:

1. [`index.astro` file](./src/pages/index.astro): This is the main file that contains the markup for the website. Make sure to modify the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to match your own information.

2. [`data` directory](./src/data/): This directory contains all the data that is shown on the website. You can modify the `.json` files to include your own information.

3. [`public/images` directory](./public/images/): This directory contains all the images that are used in the website. Replace these, specially the project images, with your own.

I recommend you to use the [`Shots`](https://shots.so/) app to create mockups of your projects and the [`Squoosh`](https://squoosh.app/) web app to compress your images before using them in the website. You should also consider using the [`.webp`](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) format for your images to reduce the page load time.
